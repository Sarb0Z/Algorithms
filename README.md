# Algorithms

This repository houses implementations of various algorithms, primarily for the purpose of practicing and honing coding skills in the context of LeetCode-style challenges. 

## Project Overview

The core focus of this project is **efficiency and clarity**. Each algorithm implementation aims to be:

* **Correct:**  Passing test cases and accurately solving the intended problem.
* **Optimized:**  Striving for the best possible time and space complexity.
* **Readable:**  Written with clear comments and wsell-structured code to enhance understanding.

Currently, the project measures the execution time of each algorithm on specific datasets to provide a basic performance benchmark.

## Development Flow

1. **Algorithm Selection:**  Choose an algorithm you want to implement or practice. We use Leetcode as a source for finding algorithm problems.

2. **Implementation:** 
   * Create a new file (e.g., `[algorithm_name].py`, `[algorithm_name].cpp`, etc.) within the appropriate directory for the chosen programming language.
   * Implement the algorithm with a focus on clarity and efficiency.
   * Include comments to explain the logic, especially for complex parts.

3. **Testing:**
   * Write test cases to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
   * Consider edge cases and various input scenarios.

4. **Benchmarking (Optional):**
   * If you'd like to benchmark your implementation, you can add a section to measure its execution time on a relevant dataset. 
   * Ensure consistency in benchmarking methods across the project.
